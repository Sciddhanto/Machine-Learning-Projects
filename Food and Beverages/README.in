# Wine Quality Prediction Using Random Forest

## Project Overview
This project uses the **Random Forest algorithm** to predict the quality of wine based on chemical properties. The dataset includes physicochemical attributes of wine and a target variable indicating its quality.

---

## Objectives
- Preprocess the dataset by handling missing values and scaling features.
- Build and train a **Random Forest classifier** for wine quality prediction.
- Evaluate model performance using accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.

## Dataset Description
### Features:
- Fixed Acidity
- Volatile Acidity
- Citric Acid
- Residual Sugar
- Chlorides
- Free Sulfur Dioxide
- Total Sulfur Dioxide

- Alcohol

### Target Variable:
- Quality (Wine quality score)

---

## Key Steps
### 1. Data Preprocessing
- Handled missing values.
- Normalized features to improve model performance.

### 2. Model Training
- Used Random Forest classifier for training.

### 3. Model Evaluation
- Split data into training and testing sets.
- Assessed performance using accuracy, confusion matrix, and classification report.
